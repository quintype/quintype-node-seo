The Quintype seo plugin handles most of the SEO tags that Quintype publishers usually add as a best practice. This includes
* Adding the AMP tags for story pages if enabled
* Ensuring Article / NewsArticle schemas are present if enabled
* Ensuring og images and other social sharing tags are present

This documentation is still WIP. However, many topics might be covered in the [Malibu Documentation](https://developers.quintype.com/malibu) and [tutorial](https://developers.quintype.com/malibu/tutorial)
